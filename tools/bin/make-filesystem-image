# We have to pick a fixed size in advance for the .img file we create, so base it on the size
# of the original Docker image to avoid either wasting space or having the later tar extraction
# step fail with out of disk space errors. The image will be mounted read-only at runtime, so
# does not need free space for app files (separate mounts are used for those). The multiplier

# as to ensure a few MB additional free space headroom.
