# Starting in Ubuntu 24.04, OpenSSL includes a symlink from `/usr/lib/ssl/cert.pem` to
# `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`, inherited from the upstream Debian package:
# https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/commit/?h=applied/ubuntu/noble&id=3bf1e1c1e4125bc1a51bf5113969270e1ba72b2e
# https://bugs-devel.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=805646
# However, this causes a significant performance regression for use-cases where the
# certs or clients aren't cached/reused. As such, we remove the symlink to restore the
# behaviour and performance of Ubuntu 22.04 and older. For more details see:
